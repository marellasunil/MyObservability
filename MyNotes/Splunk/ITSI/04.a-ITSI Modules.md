# ITSI Modules

Note: Module builder was removed in ITSI version 4.4.0 & higher. Module builder functiobnality is replaced by the ability the Splunk App for Content packs.

ITSImodules are Splunk apps. Check installed modules in the app manager (apps starting with
DA-ITSI-â€¦) or in ITSI Configure > Modules

Initial ITSI configured with number of modules, contains pre-configured data models, base searches, KPIs, entity discovery searches & visualisations for a range of common service types like OS monitoring, App / web servers or Databases etc

These can be used during service planning and definition to accelerate service implementation

Ex: Operating system modules<br>

- Use this module to quickly build KPIs that measure server metrics, like memory, CPU and storage status<br>
- Depends on events coming from add-ons like Splunk_TA_nix, etc.<br>
- Inventory events from OS sources like *:Version are used to detect and add hosts as entities automatically<br>
- Provides the OS Host Details dashboard to inspect detailed status about devices in your environment<br>

<h2>Configuring Modules</h2>
Some modules have configuration requirements like the Operating System Module can  automatically import entities based on information from the nix and windows add-ons, but needs to know what indexes store the relevant events.<br>
<br>
Edit the <b>itsi_os_module_indexes</b> macro in the module to add the name(s) of the indexes that should be searched for entities.<br>
